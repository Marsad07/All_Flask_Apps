# Flask_App_1

This is a foundational Flask web app built as part of my early exploration into web development with Python. It focuses on understanding routing, templates, and basic HTML rendering.

##  Features

- Simple Flask setup with `app.py`
- Basic route handling (`/`, `/about`, etc.)
- HTML templates using Jinja2
- Static file support (CSS, images)
